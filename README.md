## Music Generation and Manipulation using Hugging Face MusicGen

This project leverages Hugging Faceâ€™s **MusicGen** model to generate and manipulate music through deep learning techniques. By using pre-trained models, you can create unique soundtracks and audio outputs by simply providing textual prompts or conditioning on existing audio files. The project is designed for ease of use, allowing users to generate music without deep expertise in audio processing.

### Features

- **Text-to-Music Generation**: Create original music by providing text descriptions. For example, generate a "calm ambient track" or "upbeat electronic music."
- **Music-to-Music**: Input an existing piece of music and modify or extend it based on different conditioning.
- **Real-time Interaction**: Using an interface powered by Gradio, users can input prompts and receive audio outputs instantly.

### Models Used
- **Hugging Face MusicGen**: A transformer-based model for generating high-quality music from text prompts.
- **Pre-trained Models**: Leverage pre-trained models from Hugging Face's `transformers` library for music generation tasks.
- **PyTorch**: Backbone framework for running and fine-tuning the models.

### Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/music-gen.git
    ```

2. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. Download the pre-trained MusicGen model:
    ```python
    from transformers import MusicGenModel, MusicGenProcessor
    
    model = MusicGenModel.from_pretrained("facebook/musicgen-large")
    processor = MusicGenProcessor.from_pretrained("facebook/musicgen-large")
    ```

4. Run the notebook or script:
    ```bash
    python generate_music.py
    ```

### Usage

- **Text Prompt**: 
    Provide a textual prompt like `"happy acoustic guitar melody"` to generate music based on this description.
  
    ```python
    input_text = "happy acoustic guitar melody"
    inputs = processor(input_text, return_tensors="pt")
    generated_audio = model.generate(inputs.input_ids)
    ```

- **Audio File Input**:
    You can also upload an audio file and generate variations or add layers using the pre-trained models.

### Interactive Interface

You can interact with the model using Gradio's simple web interface. This allows users to input text or upload audio files and get instant audio outputs.

```bash
python app.py
```

The interface will run locally, and you can access it via your browser to generate music in real-time.
